# Mobile Internet Service Playwright Automation

[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/FolkFizz/mobile-internet-service-playwright-automation/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FolkFizz/mobile-internet-service-playwright-automation/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)
![Allure Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Allure_Report-Enabled-999999?style=flat&logo=qameta&logoColor=white)

A robust, production-grade E2E automation framework verifying functional, security, and accessibility standards.

**Target Application:** https://mobile-internet-service-sandbox.onrender.com

## Execution Highlights (Latest Run)

> **"Quality over Quantity, Stability over Speed"**

This framework successfully executed **213 test scenarios** across Desktop and Mobile configurations with a **97.18% Pass Rate** on executed tests.

### Key Metrics

- **Total Scenarios:** 213
- **Passed:** 207 ✅
- **Failed:** 0 ❌
- **Skipped:** 6 ⏭️ (Firefox Mobile - *see Architecture Decisions*)
- **Flakiness Recovered:** 10 scenarios (Auto-healed via retry mechanism)

## Device Matrix & Architecture Decisions

Unlike standard tests that run on a single viewport, this framework dynamically generates test suites for **70+ Device Profiles** (iPhone, Pixel, etc.) to ensure responsive design integrity.

### Architecture Decision: Firefox Mobile Exclusion

Mobile tests in this framework are explicitly scoped to **Chromium** and **WebKit** engines.

- **Context:** Playwright's mobile emulation (`isMobile: true`) relies on specific Chrome DevTools Protocols (CDP) to simulate touch events and viewports accurately.
- **Challenge:** The Firefox (Gecko) engine currently has limited support for these touch emulation primitives. Forcing it often results in "false negatives" (engine errors, not app errors).
- **Resolution:** To maintain high reliability and avoid flaky noise, mobile tests are strictly scoped to **Chromium (Android)** and **WebKit (iOS)**.

---

## Stability & Resilience (Self-Healing)

Mobile emulation is prone to rendering flakiness (timeouts, animation lags). This framework implements a **Smart Retry Strategy** (`retries: 2`).

**Evidence:** The screenshot below shows a test that failed on the first attempt (network/render lag) but was automatically retried and passed, preventing a false pipeline failure.

## Tech Stack

- **Core Framework:** Playwright, TypeScript, Page Object Model (POM)
- **Specialized Tools:**
  - `@axe-core/playwright` — Accessibility / WCAG 2.1 audits
  - `allure-playwright` — Advanced reporting
  - GitHub Actions — CI/CD pipeline automation

## Test Coverage Strategy

| Coverage Area | What It Validates |
|:--------------|:------------------|
| **Functional E2E** | Complete checkout flow (Login → Select Package → Payment) |
| **Negative Testing** | UI validation & edge cases (Invalid phone, no package selected) |
| **Data-Driven Testing** | Parameterized scenarios across packages, payment methods, and discount logic |
| **API Security** | Backend vulnerability checks (BOLA / Unauthenticated top-up detection) |
| **Mobile Emulation** | Responsive flow on iPhone & Pixel devices (Portrait/Landscape) |
| **Accessibility (A11y)** | Automated WCAG 2.1 audits (color contrast, ARIA behavior) |

---

## Known Bugs (Automation Findings)

| Severity | Defect Description | Status |
|:---------|:-------------------|:-------|
| **Critical** | API `/api/order` accepts requests without Auth Token (Security flaw) | Open (Expected failure) |
| **Serious** | Login button contrast ratio (3.76) fails WCAG AA standard | Open (Expected failure) |
| **Serious** | Modal overlay has `aria-hidden` focus issues (aria-hidden-focus) | Open (Expected failure) |

## How to Run

### 1. Standard Execution

Run all tests in headless mode (default):

```bash
npm install
npx playwright test
```

### 2. Targeted Execution (Examples)

Run specific test suites to verify key features:

**Mobile Viewport (iPhone Emulation):**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/mobile-checkout.spec.ts
```

**Accessibility Audit (WCAG 2.1):**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/a11y/accessibility.spec.ts
```

**API Security Scan:**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/api/security.spec.ts
```

### 3. Generate & View Allure Report (Recommended)

This project uses Allure Report for detailed visualization.

**Step 1: Generate Report**
```bash
npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
```

**Step 2: Open Report in Browser**
```bash
npx allure open allure-report
```
